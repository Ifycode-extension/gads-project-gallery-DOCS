# Contributing guidelines

[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](contributing.md)

Thank you for your interest to contribute to the GADS project gallery and documentation project. Contributions are open to learners and mentors from any of the three tracks in the Google Africa Developer Scholarship program. If you choose to add your individual or team project\(s\) to the project gallery, please note that adding it here is NOT a submission to the GADS team. Make sure to submit your project(s) as instructed by the GADS team or your mentors, before coming to add your project(s) to the project gallery. You can [read about the project](https://obiagba-mary.gitbook.io/gads-projects/about-the-project) to get a better understanding of the GADS project gallery and documentaion project.

## Ways you can contribute to the project

Once you have made a contribution, you will be added to the [GADS contributors](https://github.com/gads-projects/doc/blob/main/contributor.md). Here are ways you can contribute to the GADS project gallery doc project:


* Add your GADS projects to the [gallery repo](https://github.com/gads-projects/gallery)
* Get assigned to issues or tasks present on [the issues page](https://github.com/gads-projects/doc/issues)
* Update outdated information in the [GADS project gallery doc](https://github.com/gads-projects/doc)
* [Create an issue](https://github.com/gads-projects/doc/issues) to suggest and or add content, sections, files or page to the doc repo or the gallery repo
* [Create an issue](https://github.com/gads-projects/doc/issues) to report and fix problems such as broken links, grammatical or typographical errors present in the doc repo or the gallery repo

## Editing the documentation

You can locate the file you want to edit in the [doc repo](https://github.com/gads-projects/doc) by manually searching for the file in the doc repo or via the edit on Github button on the [Gitbook doc](https://obiagba-mary.gitbook.io/gads-projects). Go to a particular page on the Gitbook doc, then click on the edit on Github button \(or github icon in the case of smaller devices\) to take you to the exact file to edit. [Watch video tutorial](https://obiagba-mary.gitbook.io/gads-projects/contribution-guide/video-tutorials) or follow these steps to edit the file since you cannot directly make changes to the repo:


* Fork the [doc repo](https://github.com/gads-projects/doc) \(if you haven't\)
* From your fork, [create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) and give it your preferred name
* Edit the page in your fork. Make sure you are in the new branch you created when editing
* [Send a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Adding your project to the gallery

Please note that the projects you add MUST be projects made during the GADS program. Projects can be submitted by learners or mentors, can be an individual project or team project and can be projects given by the GADS team or your peer learning group mentors.
