# About the project

This documentation guide is a Google Africa Developer Scholarship \(2021\) project made by the [MWS-030 learning phase 1 peer learning group, together with other interested learners and mentors from other peer learning groups](https://github.com/gads-projects/doc/blob/main/contributor.md). Contributions are welcome from any GADS learner or mentor. The project is built to help in the following areas:

* Create a [project gallery](https://github.com/gads-projects/gallery) where learners can display projects made during GADS program.


* Encourage ourselves and GADS learners in subsequent years by the projects we make.
* Simulate a real world open source project or organisation where anyone is welcome to contribute.
* Practice use of Github, alongside other people and with no code writing involved.
* Have a real world and working portfolio project that can be presented anywhere.

**Note:** If you choose to add your projects to the project gallery, you will only be added as one of the [contributors to the project doc](https://github.com/gads-projects/doc/blob/main/contributor.md). The GADS team will not come to the gallery to check your project. Please submit your projects as instructed by the GADS team first, before you come here to add your projects. Reach out to any of the program assistants or mentors incase you have questions.
